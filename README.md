#### Implementation of the Stochastic Oscillator for Trading by Pascal U. Foerster.

This is a basic implementation of the Stochastic Oscillator, using Yahoo Finance data to explore the market developments of a company and also analyse historic data for buy and sell signals according to the stochastic oscillator.

This code is still under development, and some of the functionality currently relies on code edits rather than proper inputs.

Thank you for your interest!
Pascal
